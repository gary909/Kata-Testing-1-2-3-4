        Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.<br>
<br>
        Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.<br>
<br>
        The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.<br>
<br>
        Examples: (Input --> Output)<br>
<br>
        [] --> []<br>
        ["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]<br>
    </p>
